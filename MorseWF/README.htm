<h1>MorseWF Installation</h1>
You should allow at least half an hour to install MorseWF and associated system
software. The good news is that this only needs to be done once per computer.
Installing future updates to the program is a much simpler process.
<p>The following instructions apply to all versions of Windows (XP, Vista,
Windows 7, Windows 8 and 8.1, and Windows 10).</p>
<b>A) Download the MorseWF files</b>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
  <li>Open the compressed file at <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/morsekob/morsekob40/downloads/MorseWF.zip?attredirects=0">sites.google.com/site/morsekob/morsekob40/downloads/MorseWF.zip</a>.</li>
  <li>Copy the unzipped MorseWF folder to your hard drive.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>B) Install Python and related software</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Download and install the latest version of Python 3 from <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">python.org/downloads</a>.</li>
  <li>Install pygame and pySerial (Python modules required by MorseWF) by
    double-clicking on the Install Modules batch file in the MorseWF folder.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>C) Verify the installation</b></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
  <li>Connect the key/sounder interface and the jack box to USB ports on the
    computer. Drivers for these devices may need to have been installed already.</li>
  <li>Open the MorseWF folder.</li>
  <li>Double-click on the SysCheck&nbsp;Run batch file. A command prompt window
    with a black background appears briefly while the program is running.</li>
  <li>The SysCheck program creates a new text file, SysCheck&nbsp;Data. Open
    this file by double-clicking on its icon. The contents should be something
    similar to the following:<br>
    <br>
    <code>Python 3.3.2 (v3.3.2:d047928ae3f6, May 16 2013, 00:03:43) [MSC v.1600
    32 bit (Intel)] on win32<br>
    pygame 1.9.2a0<br>
    pySerial 2.7<br>
    MorseKOB 4.0-21<br>
    Prolific USB-to-Serial Comm Port (COM3)<br>
    Arduino Uno (COM4)<br>
    </code>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Make a note of the comm port numbers for future reference.</li>
</ol>
<b>D) Edit the config file</b>
<p>The MorseWF folder contains a configuration file named config.py. This file
tells the MorseWF program which serial port to use for an external key and/or
sounder, whether to use the speakers as a simulated sounder, and which port to
use for the jack box.</p>
<p>Use Notepad to edit this file as required. (<i>Right</i>-click on the config
file, and select Open with &gt; Notepad.) A pound sign (#) at the beginning of a
line tells the program to ignore that line. For example, the following config
file would be used in the case where a key is connected to COM7, audio should be
enabled to take the place of an actual sounder, and the jack box is connected to
COM8.</p>
<blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">
  <code># MorseWF configuration settings<br>
  <br>
  # A line starting with a pound sign (#) is treated as a comment and is<br>
  # ignored by the system.<br>
  <br>
  #PORT = None<br>
  PORT = 'COM7'<br>
  <br>
  #AUDIO = True<br>
  AUDIO = False<br>
  <br>
  #JACKPORT = None<br>
  JACKPORT = 'COM8'<br>
  <br>
  FONTNAME = '' # default system font<br>
  #FONTNAME = 'arial'<br>
  #FONTNAME = 'timesnewroman'<br>
  FONTSIZE = 28<br>
  <br>
  SCREENSIZE = None # default screen size<br>
  #SCREENSIZE = (1366, 768) # override automatic screen size<br>
  <br>
  </code>
</blockquote>
<b>E) Edit the MorseMR-xx batch file</b>
<p>The MorseWF folder contains a number of batch files of the form MorseMR-xx.
These batch files are used to launch the MorseWF program for office xx, and they
contain the following command line parameters:</p>
<blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">
  <i>wire</i><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>– default KOB
  wire no.<br>
  <i>idText</i><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>– office call,
  etc.<br>
  <i>wpm</i><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>– code speed<br>
  <br>
</blockquote>
If you're using a jack box, you may want to edit the batch file to change the
wire number to zero. This causes the program to run in standalone mode when the
plug is removed from the jack box; otherwise, the program connects to the
default wire when the plug is removed. The ID parameter needs to end with a
pound sign (#) followed by a four-digit PIN code to give access to the Wells
Fargo private wires. The code speed parameter determines the speed of the Morse
sent by the computer when using the keyboard, and it should also be close to the
fastest speed of any incoming Morse for the program to display decoded text
reliably. <i>Right</i>-click on a batch file and select Edit to open it in
Notepad if you wish to make any changes.
<p><b>F) Create shortcuts</b></p>
<p>To make it easier to start up the program, you may wish to create desktop
shortcut for the MorseWF-xx batch file. To do this,<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><i>right</i>-click
on the batch file and select Send to &gt; Desktop.</p>
<p>To launch the program automatically whenever the computer is booted, move the
shortcut to the Windows Startup folder.</p>
