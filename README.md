# MorseKOB Version 4 - Python

Written by Les Kerr, this is a Python library and programs that implement 
the MorseKOB functionality. A user interface hasn't been completed yet, 
but the library functions on pykob provide modules and functions that 
can be used within a Python program to perform MorseKOB operations.
